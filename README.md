# ToDoList 
Welcome to the To-Do List Application, a simple yet powerful task management tool built using Node.js and PostgreSQL.     
This application provides a user-friendly interface for managing daily tasks, allowing users to stay organized, set priorities, and complete tasks efficiently. With full CRUD functionality, users can easily create new tasks, update task details and delete tasks they no longer need.     
This project not only helps users stay on top of their daily tasks but also offers hands-on experience working with Node.js and PostgreSQL.     
It demonstrates work with relational databases(persistent storage using PostgreSQL), and build server-side logic—all while creating a practical tool for personal use.
